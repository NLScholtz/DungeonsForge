# DungeonsForge
The Dungeons Forge app is an online tool that utilizes an API to generate custom characters for use in online games and RPGs. Users can input their desired specifications, such as gender, race, class, and appearance, and the API draws from a database of pre-made character models and attributes to generate a unique and cohesive character.
